# Binarble

> 0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣1️⃣1️⃣0️⃣ A little Wordle-like website with binary code. But the binary system only uses 2 characters, which kind of defeats the purpose of the Wordle, so you don't have to guess anything here

Another difference from the original Wordle game is the 6-digit input instead of 5-digit, just because it allows more different numbers to be playable (0-63).

The decimal number is editable, if you click on it, so you can cheat a little bit. You can also specify the number in the URL query parameter 'n', for example https://binarble.skrw.me/?n=6 will always ask for 6 in binary.
